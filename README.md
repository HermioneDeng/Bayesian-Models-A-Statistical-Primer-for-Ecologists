# Bayesian-Models-A-Statistical-Primer-for-Ecologists
This is a code repository for class *ESS 575: Models for Ecological Data* taught by Dr. Tom Hobbs during 2022 Fall Semester at Colorado State Univeresity. 

## Goals of the course
Virtually all progress in science requires using models to gain insight from data. This course is about enhancing understanding of ecology using mathematics, statistics, and observations. The ultimate goal of the course is to master the fundamental principles needed for analysis of a broad range of problems in ecological research, undaunted by their idiosyncrasies. The emphasis on basic principles comes from my strongly held belief that what you know is not as important as what you are capable of learning. A principles-based approach assures you will be able to continue learning new, quantitative approaches to research throughout your career.

The goals of the course are to:

1. Learn modern methods for gaining insight about ecological processes using deterministic models, probability models, and data.

2. Build a foundation of principles needed to support an intuitive, flexible approach to analysis of ecological data and to foster life-long self-teaching.

3. Provide the conceptual grounding needed for effective collaboration with statisticians.

4. Develop the understanding, skill, and confidence needed to use mathematical and statistical models in your research.



## Learning outcomes
The course will include lectures and laboratory exercises. Labs will emphasize problem solving requiring programming in R and JAGS. The course will enable participants to:

1. Explain key principles of Bayesian statistics, including the concepts of joint, conditional, and marginal probabilities; posterior and prior distributions; likelihood; conjugacy; and the relationship between Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches to inference.

2. Use basic statistical distributions (e.g., binomial, Poisson, normal, lognormal, multinomial, beta, Dirichlet, gamma, multivariate normal) to write posterior and conditional joint distributions for hierarchical Bayesian models that couple models of ecological processes and models of data.

3. Explain how Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods can be used to approximate the marginal posterior distributions of parameters and other unobserved quantities.

4. Write algorithms and computer code in R implementing MCMC methods to find the marginal posterior distribution of a single parameter.

5. Use JAGS software to implement MCMC methods for approximating posterior distributions of parameters, latent states, and derived quantities.

6. Evaluate model convergence and assess goodness of fit of models to data.

7. Develop and implement hierarchical models that explicitly partition uncertainties.

8. Understand the basis for statistical inference from single and multiple Bayesian models.
